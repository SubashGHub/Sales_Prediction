## 🚀 Project Overview
- Develop a predictive model to forecast video game sales and identify key market trends.
- Data Analysis: Utilize statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to analyze patterns and correlations in the data.
- Model Development: Create and train a model to predict future sales based on identified trends and historical data.
- Validation: Test the model's accuracy with a subset of data and refine the approach for improved predictions.

## 📁 Dataset
- The Video Game Sales data as of December 22, 2016 has total of 16 features and 16,720 samples data. 
- The dataset encompasses various attributes such as game names, platforms, release years, genres, publishers, and more. 

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing
- Handling Missing Data: Various techniques were used to clean the dataset.
- Encoding: Applied Label Encoding to convert categorical variables into numerical values.
- Standardization: Standardized numeric features to ensure consistent scaling.
- Handling Outliers: Removing or transforming outliers using techniques such as IQR, Z-score, or log transformations.
## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Analyzing the data distribution: Descriptive statistics, data visualization (e.g., histograms, box plots).
- Correlation analysis: Looking at relationships between variables (e.g., heatmaps).



## 🤖 Modeling and Prediction
- Selecting relevant features.
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- Training with suitable different models.
- Evaluating and plotting the predictions.

## 📊 Results
- Performance Metrics: Evaluated using accuracy, precision, RMSE, and F1-score.
